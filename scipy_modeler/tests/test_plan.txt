Overview: 
---------
    1. Test table struc well - use get_table_fields to help testing.  

    2. Test database (just the basics its not very complex).  

    3. Test read in using a table struc a) gives you what you think it will? and b) matches spss modeller (with the knowledge 
    that some of the SPSS data types might be innacurate and later corrected by type nodes).  

    4. Test proprocessing API (table.py and table_h.py) - following along with the SPSS modeler stream we use for
    testing (some nodes, like type nodes, dont matter. The distinct, generate flag, join, filter and any other main 
    nodes matter). IGNORE THE MODELLING AND DATA SEGREDATION NODE AT THE END OF THE SPSS STREAM. 
    Are the helper functions in table_h working as we think tey are??  

Specifics:
----------
Generate Struc
    See default struc when nothing but schema and table is passed  
    Add non-int column to int list, non-float column to float list, etc.  
    Change dt naming convention to something else that would capture a different, non-date column  
    See that all columns were classified as they should be
